            <h2>Founding</h2>
            <p>
                Crescent city was founded by Native American tribes, including the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and
                Wiyot. The city was
                named after the crescent-shaped stretch of sandy beach south of the city. European settlers arrived in
                the 1850s and took over the town.
                The city then became an important port on the California coast, serving as a gateway to the gold fields
                of california, as well as an access point for the redwood forests. <br>
                The Battery Point Lighthouse, a defining landmark of the city, was built in 1856. It is still standing today and is open to the public.
                You can access the lighthouse on foot at low tide.
